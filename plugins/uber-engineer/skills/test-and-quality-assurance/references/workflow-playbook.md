# Test & Quality Assurance — Workflow Playbook

This is the long-form companion to `SKILL.md`. Load when you need the detailed step-by-step.

## Phase 1 — Intake (5 minutes)

Ask once, then commit. Do not pile up clarifying questions.

1. What's the surface? (route, file, service, model, etc.)
2. What's the user-visible outcome? Loading + empty + error + populated all need to work.
3. What does the existing code look like? Read before you propose.
4. Is there a deadline or constraint that changes the strategy?

If the user request crosses disciplines, call `discipline-router` first.

## Phase 2 — Source crawl

For any non-trivial technical claim:

1. Call Context7 MCP first for live docs.
2. Check the relevant entries in `official-sources.md`.
3. If a community blog is the only source, label the claim as "non-authoritative".

Never write API syntax from memory for SDKs that change quickly. Always check version.

## Phase 3 — Plan

Write a 5-10 line plan before touching files. Include:

- The exact change and where.
- The verification you'll run.
- The rollback if it goes wrong.

## Phase 4 — Execute

Match the capability to the artifact:

- **Design a test pyramid that's mostly unit, then component/contract, then E2E** → Test strategy doc: what runs in unit, integration, E2E, and where.
- **Apply mutation testing where it pays off (Stryker, mutmut)** → Contract test pair (consumer + provider) with broker URL.
- **Use contract tests to keep client and server in sync** → E2E happy-path spec with retries-on-known-flake disabled.
- **Run Playwright/Cypress against ephemeral environments** → Visual regression baseline + diff threshold.
- **Add visual regression gates on a small, intentional surface — not the whole app** → Flake report with quarantine queue.
- **Wire flake quarantine + flake budget so flaky tests don't rot the suite** → Coverage report by directory, not by file.

## Phase 5 — Verify

Every item in `SKILL.md` § "Verification required before claiming done" must pass. Capture evidence —
log line, screenshot, test output. Don't claim verification you didn't do.

## Phase 6 — Hand back

Tell the user:

- What shipped (in user terms, not file paths).
- What's now visible / changed for the visitor.
- What still needs attention, with severity.

No "great question," no apology preambles, no transformation arcs.

## Edge cases

- Repo state surprises: stop and ask, don't paper over.
- Conflicting docs: follow the most recent official source, log the conflict.
- Deadline pressure: shrink scope, never shrink verification.
- Cross-discipline scope creep: hand back to `discipline-router`.
