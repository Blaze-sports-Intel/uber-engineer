# Test And Quality Assurance — Workflow Playbook

This is the long-form companion to `SKILL.md`. Load when you need the detailed step-by-step.

## Phase 1 — Intake (5 minutes)

Ask once, then commit. Do not pile up clarifying questions.

1. What's the surface? (route, file, service, model, contract, schema, scene, etc.)
2. What does "done" look like for this discipline? (See the definition-of-done states in `quality-rubric.md`.)
3. What does the existing code look like? Read before you propose.
4. Is there a deadline or constraint that changes the strategy?

If the user request crosses disciplines, call `discipline-router` first.

## Phase 2 — Source crawl

For any non-trivial technical claim:

1. Call Context7 MCP first for live docs.
2. Check the relevant entries in `official-sources.md`.
3. If a community blog is the only source, label the claim as "non-authoritative".

Never write API syntax from memory for SDKs that change quickly. Always check version.

## Phase 3 — Plan

Write a 5-10 line plan before touching files. Include:

- The exact change and where.
- The verification you'll run.
- The rollback if it goes wrong.

## Phase 4 — Execute

Match the capability to the artifact:

- **Design a test pyramid that's mostly unit, then component/contract, then E2E.** → Test strategy doc: what runs in unit, integration, E2E, and where.
- **Apply mutation testing where it pays off (Stryker, mutmut).** → Mutation report on critical modules with the agreed score threshold.
- **Use contract tests to keep client and server in sync.** → Contract test pair (consumer + provider) with broker URL.
- **Run Playwright/Cypress against ephemeral environments.** → E2E happy-path spec with retries-on-known-flake disabled, running against per-PR ephemeral envs.
- **Add visual regression gates on a small, intentional surface — not the whole app.** → Visual regression baseline + diff threshold.
- **Wire flake quarantine + flake budget so flaky tests don't rot the suite.** → Flake report with quarantine queue, plus a coverage report by directory (not by file).

## Phase 5 — Verify

Every item in `SKILL.md` § "Verification required before claiming done" must pass. Capture evidence —
log line, screenshot, test output, profiler trace, scope reading, signed transaction hash, whatever
counts as proof in this discipline. Don't claim verification you didn't do.

## Phase 6 — Hand back

Tell the user:

- What shipped (in user terms, not file paths).
- What's now true that wasn't before (visible behavior, capacity, posture).
- What still needs attention, with severity.

No "great question," no apology preambles, no transformation arcs.

## Edge cases

- Repo state surprises: stop and ask, don't paper over.
- Conflicting docs: follow the most recent official source, log the conflict.
- Deadline pressure: shrink scope, never shrink verification.
- Cross-discipline scope creep: hand back to `discipline-router`.
