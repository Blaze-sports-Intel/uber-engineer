# Mobile Development — Workflow Playbook

This is the long-form companion to `SKILL.md`. Load when you need the detailed step-by-step.

## Phase 1 — Intake (5 minutes)

Ask once, then commit. Do not pile up clarifying questions.

1. What's the surface? (route, file, service, model, contract, schema, scene, etc.)
2. What does "done" look like for this discipline? (See the definition-of-done states in `quality-rubric.md`.)
3. What does the existing code look like? Read before you propose.
4. Is there a deadline or constraint that changes the strategy?

If the user request crosses disciplines, call `discipline-router` first.

## Phase 2 — Source crawl

For any non-trivial technical claim:

1. Call Context7 MCP first for live docs.
2. Check the relevant entries in `official-sources.md`.
3. If a community blog is the only source, label the claim as "non-authoritative".

Never write API syntax from memory for SDKs that change quickly. Always check version.

## Phase 3 — Plan

Write a 5-10 line plan before touching files. Include:

- The exact change and where.
- The verification you'll run.
- The rollback if it goes wrong.

## Phase 4 — Execute

Match the capability to the artifact:

- **Choose between native (Swift/Kotlin), Expo/React Native, and Flutter based on team and surface.** → Stack decision record: chosen runtime, why, and the constraints that would force a re-evaluation.
- **Design offline-first sync that resolves conflicts deterministically.** → Offline sync contract: source of truth, conflict policy, retry budget.
- **Handle background tasks, push, and permissions within OS limits.** → Push notification matrix: trigger, audience, deep link, expiration.
- **Wire up TestFlight / Play Console internal tracks with structured release notes.** → TestFlight / internal track release checklist.
- **Apply iOS HIG and Material 3 conventions — not invent custom navigation.** → Accessibility audit: VoiceOver / TalkBack labels, dynamic type, contrast.
- **Manage code signing, provisioning, and OTA updates without breaking shipped users.** → Native build configuration (Xcode scheme / Gradle variant) with signing strategy, plus a crash analytics dashboard wiring spec.

## Phase 5 — Verify

Every item in `SKILL.md` § "Verification required before claiming done" must pass. Capture evidence —
log line, screenshot, test output, profiler trace, scope reading, signed transaction hash, whatever
counts as proof in this discipline. Don't claim verification you didn't do.

## Phase 6 — Hand back

Tell the user:

- What shipped (in user terms, not file paths).
- What's now true that wasn't before (visible behavior, capacity, posture).
- What still needs attention, with severity.

No "great question," no apology preambles, no transformation arcs.

## Edge cases

- Repo state surprises: stop and ask, don't paper over.
- Conflicting docs: follow the most recent official source, log the conflict.
- Deadline pressure: shrink scope, never shrink verification.
- Cross-discipline scope creep: hand back to `discipline-router`.
