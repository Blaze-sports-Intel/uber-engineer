# Mobile Development — Workflow Playbook

This is the long-form companion to `SKILL.md`. Load when you need the detailed step-by-step.

## Phase 1 — Intake (5 minutes)

Ask once, then commit. Do not pile up clarifying questions.

1. What's the surface? (route, file, service, model, etc.)
2. What's the user-visible outcome? Loading + empty + error + populated all need to work.
3. What does the existing code look like? Read before you propose.
4. Is there a deadline or constraint that changes the strategy?

If the user request crosses disciplines, call `discipline-router` first.

## Phase 2 — Source crawl

For any non-trivial technical claim:

1. Call Context7 MCP first for live docs.
2. Check the relevant entries in `official-sources.md`.
3. If a community blog is the only source, label the claim as "non-authoritative".

Never write API syntax from memory for SDKs that change quickly. Always check version.

## Phase 3 — Plan

Write a 5-10 line plan before touching files. Include:

- The exact change and where.
- The verification you'll run.
- The rollback if it goes wrong.

## Phase 4 — Execute

Match the capability to the artifact:

- **Choose between native (Swift/Kotlin), Expo/React Native, and Flutter based on team and surface** → Native build configuration (Xcode scheme / Gradle variant) with signing strategy.
- **Design offline-first sync that resolves conflicts deterministically** → Offline sync contract: source of truth, conflict policy, retry budget.
- **Handle background tasks, push, and permissions within OS limits** → Push notification matrix: trigger, audience, deep link, expiration.
- **Wire up TestFlight / Play Console internal tracks with structured release notes** → TestFlight / internal track release checklist.
- **Apply iOS HIG and Material 3 conventions — not invent custom navigation** → Accessibility audit: VoiceOver / TalkBack labels, dynamic type, contrast.
- **Manage code signing, provisioning, and OTA updates without breaking shipped users** → Crash analytics dashboard wiring.

## Phase 5 — Verify

Every item in `SKILL.md` § "Verification required before claiming done" must pass. Capture evidence —
log line, screenshot, test output. Don't claim verification you didn't do.

## Phase 6 — Hand back

Tell the user:

- What shipped (in user terms, not file paths).
- What's now visible / changed for the visitor.
- What still needs attention, with severity.

No "great question," no apology preambles, no transformation arcs.

## Edge cases

- Repo state surprises: stop and ask, don't paper over.
- Conflicting docs: follow the most recent official source, log the conflict.
- Deadline pressure: shrink scope, never shrink verification.
- Cross-discipline scope creep: hand back to `discipline-router`.
